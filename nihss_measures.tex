\caption{Table of model-fit measures for NIHSS score: reader-based location model vs. CT voxel-based ROI coverage models. We see that the model using a p-value threshold of 0.0100 corresponds to the best model on all model-fit measures: adjusted and unadjusted $R^2$ are the highest; AIC, and RMSE are the smallest.  The models using ROI coverage have comparable fit measures, but each ROI coverage model outperforms the reader-based location model, notably in the $R^2$ measures.  Thus, we infer that using CT-based regions of interest may help in prediction of NIHSS score.}
