\caption{Table of model-fit measures for NIHSS score: reader-based location model vs. CT voxel-based HPR coverage models. We see that the model using a p-value threshold of .0100 corresponds to the best model on all model-fit measures: adjusted and unadjusted $R^2$ are the highest; AIC, and RMSE are the smallest.  The models using HPR coverage have comparable fit measures, but each HPR coverage model outperforms the reader-based location model, notably in the $R^2$ measures.  Thus, we infer that using CT-based regions of interest may help in prediction of NIHSS score.}
