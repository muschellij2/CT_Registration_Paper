  Objective: To determine the feasibility and acute (i.e., within 72 hrs)
  safety of three levels of systolic blood pressure reduction in subjects with
  supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage treated within 6 hrs after symptom
  onset., Design: A traditional phase I, dose-escalation, multicenter
  prospective study., Settings: Emergency departments and intensive care
  units., Patients: Patients with intracerebral hemorrhage with elevated
  systolic blood pressure {\textgreater}=170 mm Hg who present to the emergency
  department within 6 hrs of symptom onset., Intervention: Intravenous
  nicardipine to reduce systolic blood pressure to a target of: (1) 170 to 200
  mm Hg in the first cohort of patients; (2) 140 to 170 mm Hg in the second
  cohort; and (3) 110 to 140 mm Hg in the third cohort., Measurements and Main
  Results: Primary outcomes of interest were: (1) treatment feasibility
  (achieving and maintaining the systolic blood pressure goals for 18-24 hrs);
  (2) neurologic deterioration within 24 hrs; and (3) serious adverse events
  within 72 hrs. Safety stopping rules based on neurologic deterioration and
  serious adverse events were prespecified and approved by an {NIH}-appointed
  Data and Safety Monitoring Board, which provided oversight on subject safety.
  Each subject was followed-up for 3 months to preliminarily assess mortality
  and the clinical outcomes. A total of 18, 20, and 22 patients were enrolled
  in the respective three tiers of systolic blood pressure treatment goals.
  Overall, 9 of 60 patients had treatment failures (all in the last tier). A
  total of seven subjects with neurologic deterioration were observed: one
  (6\%), two (10\%), and four (18\%) in tier one, two, and three, respectively.
  Serious adverse events were observed in one subject (5\%) in tier two and in
  three subjects (14\%) in tier three. However, the safety stopping rule was
  not activated in any of the tiers. Three (17\%), two (10\%), and five (23\%)
  subjects in tiers one, two, and three, respectively, died within 3 months.,
  Conclusions: The observed proportions of neurologic deterioration and serious
  adverse events were below the prespecified safety thresholds, and the 3-month
  mortality rate was lower than expected in all systolic blood pressure tiers.
  The results form the basis of a larger randomized trial addressing the
  efficacy of systolic blood pressure reduction in patients with intracerebral
  hemorrhage., (C) 2010 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Lippincott

  A probabilistic framework is presented that enables image registration,

  The aim of this study was to determine the 30-day mortality and morbidity of
  intracerebral hemorrhage in a large metropolitan population and to determine
  the most important predictors of 30-day outcome. We reviewed the medical
  records and computed tomographic films for all cases of spontaneous
  intracerebral hemorrhage in Greater Cincinnati during 1988. Independent
  predictors of 30-day mortality were determined using univariate and
  multivariate statistical analyses. The 30-day mortality for the 188 cases of
  intracerebral hemorrhage was 44\%, with half of deaths occurring within the
  first 2 days of onset. Volume of intracerebral hemorrhage was the strongest
  predictor of 30-day mortality for all locations of intracerebral hemorrhage.
  Using three categories of parenchymal hemorrhage volume (0 to 29 cm3, 30 to
  60 cm3, and 61 cm3 or more), calculated by a quick and easy-to-use ellipsoid
  method, and two categories of the Glasgow Coma Scale (9 or more and 8 or
  less), 30-day mortality was predicted correctly with a sensitivity of 96\%
  and a specificity of 98\%. Patients with a parenchymal hemorrhage volume of
  60 cm3 or more on their initial computed tomogram and a Glasgow Coma Scale
  score of 8 or less had a predicted 30-day mortality of 91\%. Patients with a
  volume of less than 30 cm3 and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 9 or more had a
  predicted 30-day mortality of 19\%. Only one of the 71 patients with a volume
  of parenchymal hemorrhage of 30 cm3 or more could function independently at
  30 days. Volume of intracerebral hemorrhage, in combination with the initial
  Glasgow Coma Scale score, is a powerful and easy-to-use predictor of 30-day
  mortality and morbidity in patients with spontaneous intracerebral
  hemorrhage.%

  We designed a 15-item neurologic examination stroke scale for use in acute
  stroke therapy trials. In a study of 24 stroke patients, interrater
  reliability for the scale was found to be high (mean kappa = 0.69), and
  test-retest reliability was also high (mean kappa = 0.66-0.77). Test-retest
  reliability did not differ significantly among a neurologist, a neurology
  house officer, a neurology nurse, or an emergency department nurse. The
  stroke scale validity was assessed by comparing the scale scores obtained
  prospectively on 65 acute stroke patients to the patients' infarction size as
  measured by computed tomography scan at 1 week and to the patients' clinical
  outcome as determined at 3 months. These correlations (scale-lesion size r =
  0.68, scale-outcome r = 0.79) suggested acceptable examination and scale
  validity. Of the 15 test items, the most interrater reliable item (pupillary
  response) had low validity. Less reliable items such as upper or lower
  extremity motor function were more valid. We discuss methods for improving
  the reliability and validity of brief examination scales to be used in stroke
  therapy trials.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Background and Purpose— A simple clinical scale of intracerebral hemorrhage
  ({ICH}), comprising the Glasgow Coma Scale score, age, infratentorial origin,
  {ICH} volume, and intraventricular hemorrhage, was recently shown to predict
  30-day mortality. We studied how well the original {ICH} Score would predict
  morbidity and mortality and determined whether modification would improve the
  predictions. Methods— Patients admitted to a regional hospital with acute
  {ICH} in 1999 were reviewed. Independent predictors of mortality or good
  outcome (modified Rankin score ≤2) at 30 days were identified by logistic
  regression to devise a new {ICH} Score for comparison with the original
  Score. A modified Score was created by substituting National Institutes of
  Health Stroke Scale ({NIHSS}) for the Glasgow Coma Scale. Results— The
  mortality rate was 22\%, and 35\% had good outcome. Independent factors for
  mortality were high {NIHSS} score, intraventricular hemorrhage, subarachnoid
  extension, and narrow pulse pressure. Independent factors for good outcome
  were low {NIHSS} score and low admission temperature. For all {ICH} Scores,
  no patient had a maximum score of 6. Cutoff values of ≥3 and {\textless}3
  provided the best Youden’s index of diagnostic test in all {ICH} Scores for
  mortality and good outcome, respectively. The original and modified {ICH}
  Scores predict mortality equally well. The new and modified {ICH} Scores are
  slightly better for prediction of good outcome. Conclusions— All 3 {ICH}
  Scores are simple clinical grading scales. As reliable predictors of good
  outcome and/or mortality, they are useful in clinical research studies and
  standardization of clinical protocols.%

  Using death and functional status as end points, we prospectively analyzed
  the outcome 6 months after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in 166
  patients admitted to an acute-care stroke unit on the first day of their
  stroke. Seventy-one patients (43\%) died, 69 (42\%) had a satisfactory
  outcome, and 26 (16\%) had a poor functional outcome. Early (30-day) survival
  was correlated with morphologic parameters on the initial computed tomogram
  (hemorrhage size, midline shift, and intraventricular spread of the
  hemorrhage), while later (6-month) survival was correlated with age. Using
  logistic regression, we found five independent predictors of satisfactory
  outcome at 6 months: age, hemorrhage size, intraventricular spread of the
  hemorrhage, limb paresis, and communication disorders. Of these, age was the
  most important predictor by far.%

  Background and Purpose—Although several factors have been identified that
  predict outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}), no previous study has
  investigated the impact of hydrocephalus. The purpose of this study was to
  determine whether the presence of hydrocephalus after {ICH} would predict
  mortality and functional outcome. Methods—Patients with spontaneous
  supratentorial {ICH} were identified in our prospectively collected database
  to determine the following: age, sex, race, past medical history; Glasgow
  Coma Scale ({GCS}) score and blood pressure on admission; use of mechanical
  ventilation, mannitol, and ventriculostomy; and medical complications. {CT}
  scans performed within 24 hours of hemorrhage were retrospectively analyzed
  to determine lesion size and location, pineal shift, cisternal effacement,
  intraventricular hemorrhage ({IVH}), and hydrocephalus. Outcome was
  determined with use of hospital disposition (dead, nursing home,
  rehabilitation, home) and functional outcome (Functional Independence Measure
  [{FIM}]) at 3 months. Patients with and without hydrocephalus were compared
  and univariate and multivariate analyses performed to determine whether
  hydrocephalus was an independent predictor of mortality. Data are presented
  as mean±{SD}. Results—Of the 81 patients studied, 40 had hydrocephalus.
  Those with hydrocephalus were younger (57±15 versus 67±15 years), had lower
  {GCS} scores (8.2±4.2 versus 11±2.9), were more likely to have ganglionic
  or thalamic hemorrhages, and were intubated more frequently (70\% versus
  27\%). Hospital mortality was higher in patients with hydrocephalus (51\%
  versus 2\%), and fewer patients went home (21\% versus 35\%). Those who died
  had higher hydrocephalus scores (9.67±7.1 versus 5.75±4.5). Outcome was no
  different if a ventriculostomy was placed. The final logistic regression
  model included hydrocephalus score, gender, {GCS}, and pineal shift, and it
  correctly predicted 85\% of patients as dead or alive. Multivariate analyses
  indicated that hydrocephalus is an independent predictor of mortality.
  Conclusions—We conclude that hydrocephalus is an independent predictor of
  mortality after {ICH}.%

  Background and Purpose—Intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) constitutes 10\% to
  15\% of all strokes and remains without a treatment of proven benefit.
  Despite several existing outcome prediction models for {ICH}, there is no
  standard clinical grading scale for {ICH} analogous to those for traumatic
  brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or ischemic stroke. Methods—Records
  of all patients with acute {ICH} presenting to the University of California,
  San Francisco during 1997–1998 were reviewed. Independent predictors of
  30-day mortality were identified by logistic regression. A risk
  stratification scale (the {ICH} Score) was developed with weighting of
  independent predictors based on strength of association. Results—Factors
  independently associated with 30-day mortality were Glasgow Coma Scale score
  (P{\textless}0.001), age ≥80 years (P=0.001), infratentorial origin of
  {ICH} (P=0.03), {ICH} volume (P=0.047), and presence of intraventricular
  hemorrhage (P=0.052). The {ICH} Score was the sum of individual points
  assigned as follows: {GCS} score 3 to 4 (=2 points), 5 to 12 (=1), 13 to 15
  (=0); age ≥80 years yes (=1), no (=0); infratentorial origin yes (=1), no
  (=0); {ICH} volume ≥30 cm3 (=1), {\textless}30 cm3 (=0); and
  intraventricular hemorrhage yes (=1), no (=0). All 26 patients with an {ICH}
  Score of 0 survived, and all 6 patients with an {ICH} Score of 5 died.
  Thirty-day mortality increased steadily with {ICH} Score (P{\textless}0.005).
  Conclusions—The {ICH} Score is a simple clinical grading scale that allows
  risk stratification on presentation with {ICH}. The use of a scale such as
  the {ICH} Score could improve standardization of clinical treatment protocols
  and clinical research studies in {ICH}.%

  This report summarizes the findings of the {GBD} 2010 (Global Burden of
  Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors) study for hemorrhagic stroke ({HS}).
  Multiple databases were searched for relevant studies published between 1990
  and 2010. The {GBD} 2010 study provided standardized estimates of the
  incidence, mortality, mortality-to-incidence ratios ({MIR}), and
  disability-adjusted life years ({DALY}) lost for {HS} (including
  intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage) by age, sex, and income
  level (high-income countries [{HIC}]; low- and middle-income countries
  [{LMIC}]) for 21 {GBD} 2010 regions in 1990, 2005, and 2010. In 2010, there
  were 5.3 million cases of {HS} and over 3.0 million deaths due to {HS}. There
  was a 47\% increase worldwide in the absolute number of {HS} cases. The
  largest proportion of {HS} incident cases (80\%) and deaths (63\%) occurred
  in {LMIC} countries. There were 62.8 million {DALY} lost (86\% in {LMIC}) due
  to {HS}. The overall age-standardized incidence rate of {HS} per 100,000
  person-years in 2010 was 48.41 (95\% confidence interval [{CI}]: 45.44 to
  52.13) in {HIC} and 99.43 (95\% {CI}: 85.37 to 116.28) in {LMIC}, and 81.52
  (95\% {CI}: 72.27 to 92.82) globally. The age-standardized incidence of {HS}
  increased by 18.5\% worldwide between 1990 and 2010. In {HIC}, there was a
  reduction in incidence of {HS} by 8\% (95\% {CI}: 1\% to 15\%), mortality by
  38\% (95\% {CI}: 32\% to 43\%), {DALY} by 39\% (95\% {CI}: 32\% to 44\%), and
  {MIR} by 27\% (95\% {CI}: 19\% to 35\%) in the last 2 decades. In {LMIC}
  countries, there was a significant increase in the incidence of {HS} by 22\%
  (95\% {CI}: 5\% to 30\%), whereas there was a significant reduction in
  mortality rates of 23\% (95\% {CI}: -3\% to 36\%), {DALY} lost of 25\% (95\%
  {CI}: 7\% to 38\%), and {MIR} by 36\% (95\% {CI}: 16\% to 49\%). There were
  significant regional differences in incidence rates of {HS}, with the highest
  rates in {LMIC} regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia, and lowest
  rates in High Income North America and Western Europe. The worldwide burden
  of {HS} has increased over the last 2 decades in terms of absolute numbers of
  {HS} incident events. The majority of the burden of {HS} is borne by {LMIC}.
  Rates for {HS} incidence, mortality, and {DALY} lost, as well as {MIR}
  decreased in the past 2 decades in {HIC}, but increased significantly in
  {LMIC} countries, particularly in those patients ≤75 years. {HS} affected
  people at a younger age in {LMIC} than in {HIC}. The lowest incidence and
  mortality rates in 2010 were in High Income North America, Australasia, and
  Western Europe, whereas the highest rates were in Central Asia, Southeast
  Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. These results suggest that reducing the burden
  of {HS} is a priority particularly in {LMIC}. The {GBD} 2010 findings may be
  a useful resource for planning strategies to reduce the global burden of
  {HS}.%

  Criteria for selecting patients for possible surgery in the management of
  intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}) are needed to plan a prospective therapeutic
  evaluation of surgical intervention. This study specifically addressed
  patients seen in the emergency room within a few hours of the ictus, many of
  whom were still awake, to identify and subsequently exclude from surgical
  procedure those expected to recover completely and those expected to die
  regardless of treatment. We retrospectively studied 75 patients evaluated at
  a mean time of 3 hours and 37 minutes after hemispheric {ICH} to determine
  factors that would predict both good and poor outcomes at the time of
  discharge. Eighty percent of our patients presented within 6 hours of symptom
  onset. These patients were younger and had more severe lesions than did those
  presenting later, yet most were still awake (mean admission Glasgow Coma
  Scale [{GCS}] score = 11.0). Using multivariate regression, we created two
  models. The first model predicts independent outcome, i.e, Rankin 0 to 2, of
  all patients with a {GCS} score greater than 9 on admission who do not
  undergo surgery. The significant factors in this model were hemorrhage
  diameter, intraventricular extension, and age. The second model predicts poor
  outcome, i.e, Rankin 5 and death, of all patients. {GCS} score, hemorrhage
  volume, age, and gender were the important factors in this model. We conclude
  that {ICH} patients presenting early to the emergency room have more severe
  lesions radiologically, although their initial clinical status may not be
  different from those seen late. Our models should identify and thus exclude
  those with very good and very poor prognoses from future randomized surgical
  trials.%

  We reviewed the medical records and {CT} scans of 138 patients hospitalized
  for spontaneous supratentorial hemorrhage and conservatively treated.
  Seventeen clinico-anamnestic variables and five {CT} desumed findings were
  collected. Using univariate analysis we found eight significant predictors of
  30-day mortality: intraventricular spread ({IVS}) of blood, volume of the
  hemorrhage, Glasgow Coma Scale ({GCS}) score, midline shift, hyperglycemia,
  pupillary abnormalities, limb paresis and gaze deviation. With multivariate
  logistic regression analysis we found three independent predictors of 30-day
  mortality: {IVS} of blood, volume of the hemorrhage and {GCS} score. Using
  these three independent variables we developed an easy model which allows an
  immediate estimate of the probability of survival with a high degree of
  sensitivity and specificity.%

  Spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage accounts for 20\% of all
  stroke-related sudden neurological deficits, has the highest morbidity and
  mortality of all stroke, and the role of surgery remains controversial. We
  undertook a prospective randomised trial to compare early surgery with
  initial conservative treatment for patients with intracerebral haemorrhage. A
  parallel-group trial design was used. Early surgery combined haematoma
  evacuation (within 24 h of randomisation) with medical treatment. Initial
  conservative treatment used medical treatment, although later evacuation was
  allowed if necessary. We used the eight-point Glasgow outcome scale obtained
  by postal questionnaires sent directly to patients at 6 months follow-up as
  the primary outcome measure. We divided the patients into good and poor
  prognosis groups on the basis of their clinical status at randomisation. For
  the good prognosis group, a favourable outcome was defined as good recovery
  or moderate disability on the Glasgow outcome scale. For the poor prognosis
  group, a favourable outcome also included the upper level of severe
  disability. Analysis was by intention to treat. 1033 patients from 83 centres
  in 27 countries were randomised to early surgery (503) or initial
  conservative treatment (530). At 6 months, 51 patients were lost to
  follow-up, and 17 were alive with unknown status. Of 468 patients randomised
  to early surgery, 122 (26\%) had a favourable outcome compared with 118
  (24\%) of 496 randomised to initial conservative treatment (odds ratio 0·89
  [95\% {CI} 0·66–1·19], p=0·414); absolute benefit 2·3\% (–3·2 to
  7·7), relative benefit 10\% (–13 to 33). Patients with spontaneous
  supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage in neurosurgical units show no
  overall benefit from early surgery when compared with initial conservative
  treatment.%

  The balance of risk and benefit from early neurosurgical intervention for
  conscious patients with superficial lobar intracerebral haemorrhage of
  10–100 {mL} and no intraventricular haemorrhage admitted within 48 h of
  ictus is unclear. We therefore tested the hypothesis that early surgery
  compared with initial conservative treatment could improve outcome in these
  patients. In this international, parallel-group trial undertaken in 78
  centres in 27 countries, we compared early surgical haematoma evacuation
  within 12 h of randomisation plus medical treatment with initial medical
  treatment alone (later evacuation was allowed if judged necessary). An
  automatic telephone and internet-based randomisation service was used to
  assign patients to surgery and initial conservative treatment in a 1:1 ratio.
  The trial was not masked. The primary outcome was a prognosis-based
  dichotomised (favourable or unfavourable) outcome of the 8 point Extended
  Glasgow Outcome Scale ({GOSE}) obtained by questionnaires posted to patients
  at 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered,
  number {ISRCTN}22153967. 307 of 601 patients were randomly assigned to early
  surgery and 294 to initial conservative treatment; 298 and 291 were followed
  up at 6 months, respectively; and 297 and 286 were included in the analysis,
  respectively. 174 (59\%) of 297 patients in the early surgery group had an
  unfavourable outcome versus 178 (62\%) of 286 patients in the initial
  conservative treatment group (absolute difference 3·7\% [95\% {CI} −4·3
  to 11·6], odds ratio 0·86 [0·62 to 1·20]; p=0·367). The {STICH} {II}
  results confirm that early surgery does not increase the rate of death or
  disability at 6 months and might have a small but clinically relevant
  survival advantage for patients with spontaneous superficial intracerebral
  haemorrhage without intraventricular haemorrhage. {UK} Medical Research

  Background and Purpose—Perihematomal edema ({PHE}) can worsen outcomes
  after intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH}). Reports suggest that blood
  degradation products lead to {PHE}. We hypothesized that hematoma evacuation
  will reduce {PHE} volume and that treatment with recombinant tissue-type
  plasminogen activator (rt-{PA}) will not exacerbate it. Methods—Minimally
  invasive surgery and rt-{PA} in {ICH} evacuation ({MISTIE}) phase {II} tested
  safety and efficacy of hematoma evacuation after {ICH}. We conducted a
  semiautomated, computerized volumetric analysis on computed tomography to
  assess impact of hematoma removal on {PHE} and effects of rt-{PA} on {PHE}.
  Volumetric analyses were performed on baseline stability and end of treatment
  scans. Results—Seventy-nine surgical and 39 medical patients from minimally
  invasive surgery and rt-{PA} in {ICH} evacuation phase {II} ({MISTIE} {II})
  were analyzed. Mean hematoma volume at end of treatment was 19.6±14.5 cm3
  for the surgical cohort and 40.7±13.9 cm3 for the medical cohort
  (P{\textless}0.001). Edema volume at end of treatment was lower for the
  surgical cohort: 27.7±13.3 cm3 than medical cohort: 41.7±14.6 cm3
  (P{\textless}0.001). Graded effect of clot removal on {PHE} was observed when
  patients with {\textgreater}65\%, 20\% to 65\%, and {\textless}20\% {ICH}
  removed were analyzed (P{\textless}0.001). Positive correlation between {PHE}
  reduction and percent of {ICH} removed was identified (ρ=0.658;
  P{\textless}0.001). In the surgical cohort, 69 patients underwent surgical
  aspiration and rt-{PA}, whereas 10 underwent surgical aspiration only. Both
  cohorts achieved similar clot reduction: surgical aspiration and rt-{PA},
  18.9±14.5 cm3; and surgical aspiration only, 24.5±14.0 cm3 (P=0.26). Edema
  at end of treatment in surgical aspiration and rt-{PA} was 28.1±13.8 cm3 and
  24.4±8.6 cm3 in surgical aspiration only (P=0.41). Conclusions—Hematoma
  evacuation is associated with significant reduction in {PHE}. Furthermore,
  {PHE} does not seem to be exacerbated by rt-{PA}, making such neurotoxic
  effects unlikely when the drug is delivered to intracranial clot.%

  Structural delineation and assignment are the fundamental steps in
  understanding the anatomy of the human brain. The white matter has been
  structurally defined in the past only at its core regions (deep white
  matter). However, the most peripheral white matter areas, which are
  interleaved between the cortex and the deep white matter, have lacked clear
  anatomical definitions and parcellations. We used axonal fiber alignment
  information from diffusion tensor imaging ({DTI}) to delineate the peripheral
  white matter, and investigated its relationship with the cortex and the deep
  white matter. Using {DTI} data from 81 healthy subjects, we identified nine
  common, blade-like anatomical regions, which were further parcellated into 21
  subregions based on the cortical anatomy. Four short association fiber tracts
  connecting adjacent gyri (U-fibers) were also identified reproducibly among
  the healthy population. We anticipate that this atlas will be useful resource
  for atlas-based white matter anatomical studies.%

  The hospital charts and {CT} scans of 112 patients with spontaneous
  supratentorial haemorrhage were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate factors
  important to prognosis. A low Glasgow Coma Scale score, coma, ataxic
  respiration, abnormal pupils, acute hypertension, large haemorrhage size and
  intraventricular extension of blood were associated with a poor outcome.
  Multivariate analysis using the technique of logistic regression identified
  three variables, the Glasgow Coma Scale score, haemorrhage size and
  intraventricular extension of blood, which were most predictive of outcome. A

  Depth intracranial electrodes ({IEs}) placement is one of the most used
  procedures to identify the epileptogenic zone ({EZ}) in surgical treatment of
  drug resistant epilepsy patients, about 20–30\% of this population. {IEs}
  localization is therefore a critical issue defining the {EZ} and its relation
  with eloquent functional areas. That information is then used to target the
  resective surgery and has great potential to affect outcome. We designed a
  methodological procedure intended to avoid the need for highly specialized
  medical resources and reduce time to identify the anatomical location of
  {IEs}, during the first instances of intracranial {EEG} recordings. This
  workflow is based on established open source software; 3D Slicer and
  Freesurfer that uses {MRI} and Post-implant {CT} fusion for the localization
  of {IEs} and its relation with automatic labeled surrounding cortex. To test
  this hypothesis we assessed the time elapsed between the surgical
  implantation process and the final anatomical localization of {IEs} by means
  of our proposed method compared against traditional visual analysis of raw
  post-implant imaging in two groups of patients. All {IEs} were identified in
  the first 24 H (6–24 H) of implantation using our method in 4 patients of
  the first group. For the control group; all {IEs} were identified by experts
  with an overall time range of 36 h to 3 days using traditional visual
  analysis. It included (7 patients), 3 patients implanted with {IEs} and the
  same 4 patients from the first group. Time to localization was restrained in
  this group by the specialized personnel and the image quality available. To
  validate our method; we trained two inexperienced operators to assess the
  position of {IEs} contacts on four patients (5 {IEs}) using the proposed
  method. We quantified the discrepancies between operators and we also
  assessed the efficiency of our method to define the {EZ} comparing the
  findings against the results of traditional analysis.%

  Background and Purpose Black Americans with spontaneous intracerebral
  hemorrhage ({SICH}) may have unique clinical characteristics that affect
  outcome. The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of
  clinical characteristics and initial {CT} scan for outcome in black Americans
  with {SICH}. Methods Clinical and demographic data were extracted from the
  charts of 182 consecutive black Americans admitted for {SICH} diagnosed by
  clinical criteria and initial {CT} scan. Hemorrhage volumes were calculated
  from admission {CT} scans by a computerized method. Univariate and multiple
  logistic regression analyses were performed to determine independent
  predictors of early deterioration (defined as a decrease from an initial
  Glasgow Coma Scale score {\textgreater}12 by ≥4 points within 24 hours from
  presentation) and mortality. Results Both hemorrhage volume and ventricular
  extension were significant, independent predictors of early deterioration
  (odds ratio [{OR}], 6.78; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.89 to 24.35 and
  {OR}, 4.67; 95\% {CI}, 1.30 to 16.72, respectively) and mortality ({OR},
  6.66; 95\% {CI}, 2.85 to 15.58 and {OR}, 4.23; 95\% {CI}, 1.82 to 9.82,
  respectively). A Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤12 also predicted mortality
  ({OR}, 3.23; 95\% {CI}, 1.46 to 7.14). Initial mean arterial pressure was not
  an independent predictor of early deterioration or mortality. Conclusions
  Hemorrhage volume and ventricular extension are the best predictors of early
  deterioration and mortality in black Americans with {SICH}.%

  {BACKGROUND} The present study was undertaken to evaluate the determinants of
  acute (30-day) mortality after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage ({ICH})
  in a developing country setting, and to compare these findings with those
  available from studies conducted in the West. {METHODS} Medical records of
  146 patients admitted to a major tertiary hospital in Karachi, Pakistan
  between 1990 and 1991 with a diagnosis of spontaneous {ICH} were reviewed.
  The level and intensity of care provided to these patients was similar to
  that available at modern neurosurgical centers. The salient prognostic
  indicators that were studied included hypertension, pulse pressure, {GCS}
  score, neurologic deficits, and {CT}-scan predictors including site, size,
  and intraventricular spread of hemorrhage. These data were used to determine
  independent predictors of 30-day mortality by univariate and multivariate
  analysis. Additionally, 30-day survival probabilities for these outcome
  predictors were also computed. {RESULTS} The 30-day mortality after
  spontaneous {ICH} was 39.7\%. Two-thirds of the patients had a history of
  hypertension. The important clinical predictors at the multivariate level
  included {GCS} score ≤8 and progressive increase in pulse pressure. The
  {CT} scan predictors included intraventricular spread of hemorrhage,
  ventricular enlargement, and size of the bleed. Location of the lesion did
  not appear to significantly influence mortality. Survival analysis showed a
  large clustering of deaths within the first 72 hours of hospitalization.
  {CONCLUSIONS} The 30-day mortality rate and prognostic predictors for
  spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage were found to be similar to those
  reported in the Western hemisphere. However, the correlation of incremental
  increase in pulse pressure with deteriorating prognosis was a new and
  significant finding.%

  Traditionally lesion location has been reported using standard templates,
  text based descriptions or representative raw slices from the patient's {CT}
  or {MRI} scan. Each of these methods has drawbacks for the display of
  neuroanatomical data. One solution is to display {MRI} scans in the same
  stereotaxic space popular with researchers working in functional
  neuroimaging. Presenting brains in this format is useful as the slices
  correspond to the standard anatomical atlases used by neuroimagers. In
  addition, lesion position and volume are directly comparable across patients.
  This article describes freely available software for presenting
  stereotaxically aligned patient scans. This article focuses on {MRI} scans,
  but many of these tools are also applicable to other modalities (e.g. {CT},
  {PET} and {SPECT}). We suggest that this technique of presenting lesions in
  terms of images normalized to standard stereotaxic space should become the
  standard for neuropsychological studies.%

  Spatial normalization reshapes an individual's brain to match the shape and
  size of a template image. This is a crucial step required for group-level
  statistical analyses. The most popular standard templates are derived from
  {MRI} scans of young adults. We introduce specialized templates that allow
  normalization algorithms to be applied to stroke-aged populations. First, we
  developed a {CT} template: while this is the dominant modality for many
  clinical situations, there are no modern {CT} templates and popular
  algorithms fail to successfully normalize {CT} scans. Importantly, our
  template was based on healthy individuals with ages similar to what is
  commonly seen in stroke (mean 65 years old). This template allows studies
  where only {CT} scans are available. Second, we derived a {MRI} template that
  approximately matches the shape of our {CT} template as well as processing
  steps that aid the normalization of scans from older individuals (including
  lesion masking and the ability to generate high quality cortical renderings
  despite brain injury). The benefit of this strategy is that the resulting
  templates can be used in studies where mixed modalities are present. We have
  integrated these templates and processing algorithms into a simple {SPM}
  toolbox (http://www.mricro.com/clinical-toolbox/spm8-scripts).%

  The prognostic assessment of a patient with intra-cerebral hemorrhage ({IH})
  requires simultaneous appraisal of several parameters. We have attempted this
  with a multivariate method: discriminant analysis. We studied retrospectively
  142 patients with non-operated {IH}, not due to vascular malformation,
  distributed two months after the initial event in two groups: 92 living
  patients and 50 dead. Discriminant analysis of 21 parameters from the initial
  examination and {CT} scan, selected five factors which best separate the two
  groups, since 89\% of the patients were well classified. These five
  parameters (age, consciousness impairment, temperature, volume of the
  hematoma and ventricular hemorrhage) combined, give a prognostic score which
  gives for each patient his probability of survival or death. The validity of
  the proposed model was controlled on a test-sample of 66 patients from
  another department. The possibility of giving a trustworthy spontaneous
  prognosis on the first day can enable the evaluation of the possible benefit
  from surgery, which we illustrated with a group of 23 operated patients.%

  An automated method for segmenting magnetic resonance head images into brain
  and non-brain has been developed. It is very robust and accurate and has been
  tested on thousands of data sets from a wide variety of scanners and taken
  with a wide variety of {MR} sequences. The method, Brain Extraction Tool
  ({BET}), uses a deformable model that evolves to fit the brain's surface by
  the application of a set of locally adaptive model forces. The method is very
  fast and requires no preregistration or other pre-processing before being
  applied. We describe the new method and give examples of results and the
  results of extensive quantitative testing against “gold-standard” hand
  segmentations, and two other popular automated methods. Hum. Brain Mapping

  \field{abstract}{%
  We previously developed a software package called {ABLe} (analysis of brain
  lesions) which characterizes brain lesions in terms of lesion volume and
  intersection with cytoarchitecture (e.g. Brodmann areas). Since our previous
  publication, there have been significant improvements to this software
  package which utilize methods standard to the neuroimaging community. These
  features include spatial normalization to the {MNI} template brain (standard
  of the international consortium for brain mapping), and use of the volume
  occupancy Talairach labels ({VOTL}) and automated anatomical labeling ({AAL})
  atlases for full brain quantification of structures impacted by the lesion.
  Methods for multi-subject studies including lesion-symptom mapping proposed
  by Bates et al. have been extended in {ABLe} to produce an exploratory
  analysis summarizing correlations between subjects with overlapping lesions
  and behavioral deficit. A subset of data from an ongoing traumatic head
  injury study correlating deficit with brain anatomy is used to demonstrate
  the power of this software package.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  The Glasgow Coma Scale, based upon eye opening, verbal and motor responses
  has proved a practical and consistent means of monitoring the state of head
  injured patients. Observations made in the early stages after injury define
  the depth and duration of coma and, when combined with clinical features such
  as a patient's age and brain stem function, have been used to predict
  outcome. Series of cases in comparable depths of coma in Glasgow and the
  Netherlands showed remarkably similar outcomes at 3 months. Based upon
  observations made in the first 24 hours of coma after injury, data from 255
  previous cases reliably predicted outcome in the majority of 92 new patients.
  The exceptions were patients with potential to recover who later developed
  complications: no patient did significantly better than predicted.%

  \field{abstract}{%
  A clinical scale has been evolved for assessing the depth and duration of
  impaired consciousness and coma. Three aspects of behaviour are independently
  measured—motor responsiveness, verbal performance, and eye opening. These
  can be evaluated consistently by doctors and nurses and recorded on a simple
  chart which has proved practical both in a neurosurgical unit and in a
  general hospital. The scale facilitates consultations between general and
  special units in cases of recent brain damage, and is useful also in defining
  the duration of prolonged coma.%
