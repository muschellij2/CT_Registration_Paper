	abstract = {Background: Mid-life stroke risk factors have been related to late-life cognitive impairment. This association may result not only from clinical strokes but also from subclinical brain injury, such as a global atrophy demonstrable on quantitative brain {MRI.}
Methods: The authors evaluated the community-based cohort of Framingham Offspring Study participants. A total of 1,841 subjects (mean age, 62 years; 857 men, 984 women) who underwent quantitative {MRI} and cognitive testing between 1999 and 2001 and were free of clinical stroke and dementia constituted our study sample. The authors used age- and sex-adjusted linear regression models to relate previous (1991 to 1995) and recent (1998 to 2001) Framingham Stroke Risk Profile ({FSRP)} scores to the total cerebral brain volume ratio ({TCBVr)} on follow-up {MRI}, and further to relate the {TCBVr} with education-adjusted scores on neuropsychological tests administered at the time of imaging.
Results: There was an inverse association between {FSRP} scores and {TCBVr.} The {TCBVr} also showed a significant positive association with performance on tests of attention (Trails A), executive function (Trails B), and visuospatial function (visual reproduction, Hooper visual organization), but not with performance on tests of verbal memory or naming.
Conclusions: The Framingham Stroke Risk Profile may identify subjects with smaller brains and poorer cognitive function among stroke- and dementia-free subjects, reinforcing the importance of managing stroke risk factors.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose. Controlling for intracranial volume is crucial in magnetic resonance studies of changes in brain volumes. However, full intracranial volume measurement requires prolonged scanning and analysis, and simple, validated methods for intracranial volume estimation are lacking. The authors developed and evaluated a method of estimating intracranial volume using a single mid-sagittal slice, the intracranial cross-sectional area. Methods. Forty men aged 65–70 had whole skull magnetic resonance scans at 1.9 T, with slice thickness of 1.5 mm (no interslice gap). Intracranial cross-sectional area was traced in the midline sagittal slice of the 3-view localizer. Intracranial volume was measured using every slice. Ten intracranial cross-sectional area measurements were tested for interrater reliability. Results. Intracranial cross-sectional area and intracranial volume correlated highly (r= .88, P {\textless} .0001). A modified Bland-Altman plot showed good agreement between intracranial cross-sectional area and intracranial volume. The intraclass correlation (an indicator of reliability) for intracranial cross-sectional area was r= .976 (P {\textless} .005). Conclusions. The rapid and simple technique of intracranial cross-sectional area measurement provides a valid and reliable estimate of intracranial volume.},

	abstract = {The incidence of oral anticoagulation-associated intracerebral hemorrhage ({OAC-ICH)} is growing due to the increasing use of warfarin and the older age of treated patients. Recent population studies reveal that {OAC-ICH} currently occurs at a frequency comparable to that of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Most frequently, {OAC-ICH} are located in deep or lobar regions of the brain, although it may also occur in the brainstem. These hemorrhages are larger than spontaneous hematomas and may be fatal in at least 50\% of cases. The primary cause of brain injury in patients with {OAC-ICH} is the direct mechanical disruption of the brain tissue but secondary damage may occur through the intervention of matrix metalloproteinases, glutamate, cytokines, heme, iron, and the chemical toxicity of products such as thrombin, which are released from the clot. The pathogenesis of {OAC-ICH} also includes the effects of aging, the level of anticoagulation, genetic factors, and a high prevalence of concurrent cerebrovascular conditions, such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, leukoaraiosis or previous strokes. The treatment of {OAC-ICH} is challenging and involves rapid reversal of anticoagulation with hemostatic drug therapies such as vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates or recombinant factor {VIIa.} These therapies may not always be sufficient to stabilize the patient’s clinical condition and lacking randomized controlled trials, the best hematological approach to reverse oral anticoagulation is debated. Other difficult decisions reviewed in this article are whether anticoagulation should be restarted after {OAC-ICH}, and when anticoagulant treatment should be resumed. The newer oral anticoagulants, which are increasingly being introduced for thromboembolism prevention, may confer a lower risk of intracranial bleeding than warfarin, although they do not have an antidote and their anticoagulant effect is difficult to monitor.},

	abstract = {Human attentional control is unrivaled. We recently proposed that adults depend on distinct frontoparietal and cinguloopercular networks for adaptive online task control versus more stable set control, respectively. During development, both experience-dependent evoked activity and spontaneous waves of synchronized cortical activity are thought to support the formation and maintenance of neural networks. Such mechanisms may encourage tighter “integration” of some regions into networks over time while “segregating” other sets of regions into separate networks. Here we use resting state functional connectivity {MRI}, which measures correlations in spontaneous blood oxygenation level-dependent signal fluctuations between brain regions to compare previously identified control networks between children and adults. We find that development of the proposed adult control networks involves both segregation (i.e., decreased short-range connections) and integration (i.e., increased long-range connections) of the brain regions that comprise them. Delay/disruption in the developmental processes of segregation and integration may play a role in disorders of control, such as autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Tourette's syndrome.},

	abstract = {Computed tomographic ({CT)} images are widely used in the diagnosis of stroke. In this paper, we present an automated method to detect and classify an abnormality into acute infarct, chronic infarct and hemorrhage at the slice level of non-contrast {CT} images. The proposed method consists of three main steps: image enhancement, detection of mid-line symmetry and classification of abnormal slices. A windowing operation is performed on the intensity distribution to enhance the region of interest. Domain knowledge about the anatomical structure of the skull and the brain is used to detect abnormalities in a rotation- and translation-invariant manner. A two-level classification scheme is used to detect abnormalities using features derived in the intensity and the wavelet domain. The proposed method has been evaluated on a dataset of 15 patients (347 image slices). The method gives 90\% accuracy and 100\% recall in detecting abnormality at patient level; and achieves an average precision of 91\% and recall of 90\% at the slice level.},

	abstract = {Many complex networks have a small-world topology characterized by dense local clustering or cliquishness of connections between neighboring nodes yet a short path length between any (distant) pair of nodes due to the existence of relatively few long-range connections. This is an attractive model for the organization of brain anatomical and functional networks because a small-world topology can support both segregated/specialized and distributed/integrated information processing. Moreover, small-world networks are economical, tending to minimize wiring costs while supporting high dynamical complexity. The authors introduce some of the key mathematical concepts in graph theory required for small-world analysis and review how these methods have been applied to quantification of cortical connectivity matrices derived from anatomical tract-tracing studies in the macaque monkey and the cat. The evolution of small-world networks is discussed in terms of a selection pressure to deliver cost-effective information-processing systems. The authors illustrate how these techniques and concepts are increasingly being applied to the analysis of human brain functional networks derived from electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography and {fMRI} experiments. Finally, the authors consider the relevance of small-world models for understanding the emergence of complex behaviors and the resilience of brain systems to pathological attack by disease or aberrant development. They conclude that small-world models provide a powerful and versatile approach to understanding the structure and function of human brain systems.},

This technique takes into account the errors on both axes. Our results are compared with those of a simulation process based on six different real data sets. The mean error in the results from the new expressions is between 4\% and 5\%. With weighted least squares, ordinary least squares, the constant variance ratio approach and orthogonal regression, on the other hand, mean errors can be as high as 85\%, 277\%, 637\% and 1697\% respectively. An important property of the prediction intervals calculated with {BLS} is that the results are not affected when the axes are switched. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {PURPOSE:} The quantitative nature of {CT} should make it amenable to semiautomated analysis using modern neuroimaging methods. The purpose of this study was to begin to develop automated methods of analysis of {CT} scans to identify putative hypodensity within the lentiform nucleus and insula in patients with acute middle cerebral artery stroke.
{METHODS:} Thirty-five {CT} scans were retrospectively selected from our {CT} archive (scans of 20 normal control participants and 15 patients presenting with acute middle cerebral artery stroke symptoms). The {DICOM} data for each participant were interpolated to a single volume, scalp stripped, normalized to a standard atlas, and segmented into anatomic regions. Voxel densities in the lentiform nucleus and insula were compared with the contralateral side at P {\textless} .01 using the Wilcoxon two-sample rank sum statistic, corrected for spatial autocorrelation.
{RESULTS:} The quality of the registration for the anatomic regions was excellent. The control group had two false-positive results. The patient group had two false-negative results in the lentiform nucleus, two false-negative results in the insular cortex, and one false-positive finding for the insular cortex. The remainder of the infarcts were correctly identified. The original clinical reading, performed at the time of presentation, produced five false-negative interpretations for the patient group, all of which were correctly identified by the automated algorithm.
{CONCLUSION:} We present an automated method for identifying potential areas of acute ischemia on {CT} scans. This approach can be extended to other brain regions and vascular territories and may aid in the interpretation of {CT} scans in cases of hyperacute stroke.},

	abstract = {Automatic computer processing of large multidimensional images such as those produced by magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} is greatly aided by deformable models, which are used to extract, identify, and quantify specific neuroanatomic structures. A general method of deforming polyhedra is presented here, with two novel features. First, explicit prevention of self-intersecting surface geometries is provided, unlike conventional deformable models, which use regularization constraints to discourage but not necessarily prevent such behavior. Second, deformation of multiple surfaces with intersurface proximity constraints allows each surface to help guide other surfaces into place using model-based constraints such as expected thickness of an anatomic surface. These two features are used advantageously to identify automatically the total surface of the outer and inner boundaries of cerebral cortical gray matter from normal human {MR} images, accurately locating the depths of the sulci, even where noise and partial volume artifacts in the image obscure the visibility of sulci. The extracted surfaces are enforced to be simple two-dimensional manifolds (having the topology of a sphere), even though the data may have topological holes. This automatic 3-D cortex segmentation technique has been applied to 150 normal subjects, simultaneously extracting both the gray/white and gray/cerebrospinal fluid interface from each individual. The collection of surfaces has been used to create a spatial map of the mean and standard deviation for the location and the thickness of cortical gray matter. Three alternative criteria for defining cortical thickness at each cortical location were developed and compared. These results are shown to corroborate published postmortem and in vivo measurements of cortical thickness.},

Test-retest reliability did not differ significantly among a neurologist, a neurology house officer, a neurology nurse, or an emergency department nurse. The stroke scale validity was assessed by comparing the scale scores obtained prospectively on 65 acute stroke patients to the patients' infarction size as measured by computed tomography scan at 1 week and to the patients' clinical outcome as determined at 3 months. These correlations (scale-lesion size r = 0.68, scale-outcome r = 0.79) suggested acceptable examination and scale validity. Of the 15 test items, the most interrater reliable item (pupillary response) had low validity. Less reliable items such as upper or lower extremity motor function were more valid. We discuss methods for improving the reliability and validity of brief examination scales to be used in stroke therapy trials.},

We recently proposed that adults depend on distinct frontoparietal and cinguloopercular networks for adaptive online task control versus more stable set control, respectively. During development, both experience-dependent evoked activity and spontaneous waves of synchronized cortical activity are thought to support the formation and maintenance of neural networks. Such mechanisms may encourage tighter “integration” of some regions into networks over time while “segregating” other sets of regions into separate networks. Here we use resting state functional connectivity {MRI}, which measures correlations in spontaneous blood oxygenation level-dependent signal fluctuations between brain regions to compare previously identified control networks between children and adults. We find that development of the proposed adult control networks involves both segregation (i.e., decreased short-range connections) and integration (i.e., increased long-range connections) of the brain regions that comprise them. Delay/disruption in the developmental processes of segregation and integration may play a role in disorders of control, such as autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Tourette's syndrome.},

	abstract = {Spatial normalization, registration, and segmentation techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({MRI)} often use a target or template volume to facilitate processing, take advantage of prior information, and define a common coordinate system for analysis. In the neuroimaging literature, the {MNI305} Talairach-like coordinate system is often used as a standard template. However, when studying pediatric populations, variation from the adult brain makes the {MNI305} suboptimal for processing brain images of children. Morphological changes occurring during development render the use of age-appropriate templates desirable to reduce potential errors and minimize bias during processing of pediatric data. This paper presents the methods used to create unbiased, age-appropriate {MRI} atlas templates for pediatric studies that represent the average anatomy for the age range of 4.5–18.5 years, while maintaining a high level of anatomical detail and contrast. The creation of anatomical T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and proton density-weighted templates for specific developmentally important age-ranges, used data derived from the largest epidemiological, representative (healthy and normal) sample of the {U.S.} population, where each subject was carefully screened for medical and psychiatric factors and characterized using established neuropsychological and behavioral assessments. Use of these age-specific templates was evaluated by computing average tissue maps for gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid for each specific age range, and by conducting an exemplar voxel-wise deformation-based morphometry study using 66 young (4.5–6.9 years) participants to demonstrate the benefits of using the age-appropriate templates. The public availability of these atlases/templates will facilitate analysis of pediatric {MRI} data and enable comparison of results between studies in a common standardized space specific to pediatric research.},

	abstract = {This study reports the expressions for the variances in the prediction of the response and predictor variables calculated with the bivariate least squares ({BLS)} regression technique. This technique takes into account the errors on both axes. Our results are compared with those of a simulation process based on six different real data sets. The mean error in the results from the new expressions is between 4\% and 5\%. With weighted least squares, ordinary least squares, the constant variance ratio approach and orthogonal regression, on the other hand, mean errors can be as high as 85\%, 277\%, 637\% and 1697\% respectively. An important property of the prediction intervals calculated with {BLS} is that the results are not affected when the axes are switched. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Methods: Spontaneous eyes-closed and eyes-open {EEG} were recorded at 128 electrodes in 20 children aged 6–11 years and 23 adults aged 18–23 years. The surface Laplacian algorithm was applied to improve the spatial resolution of each electrode. Power and coherence were used to characterize the spatial structure of the alpha rhythm. A stochastic field model was used to eliminate coherences that are inflated due to volume conduction. Results: In adults, the alpha rhythm is characterized by very high coherence between distant electrodes. The children demonstrated reduced anterior power and coherence between anterior and posterior electrodes at the peak alpha frequency in comparison to the adults. The Laplacian alpha rhythm demonstrated much higher power in the children at both anterior and posterior electrodes, but was weakly correlated between electrodes. Conclusions: The maturation of neocortex in late childhood involves increased global correlation by long-range corticocortical connections. The local correlation that contributes power to each electrode, independent of other electrodes, is reduced as the global correlation increases.},

	abstract = {Background: Mid-life stroke risk factors have been related to late-life cognitive impairment. This association may result not only from clinical strokes but also from subclinical brain injury, such as a global atrophy demonstrable on quantitative brain {MRI.}
Methods: The authors evaluated the community-based cohort of Framingham Offspring Study participants. A total of 1,841 subjects (mean age, 62 years; 857 men, 984 women) who underwent quantitative {MRI} and cognitive testing between 1999 and 2001 and were free of clinical stroke and dementia constituted our study sample. The authors used age- and sex-adjusted linear regression models to relate previous (1991 to 1995) and recent (1998 to 2001) Framingham Stroke Risk Profile ({FSRP)} scores to the total cerebral brain volume ratio ({TCBVr)} on follow-up {MRI}, and further to relate the {TCBVr} with education-adjusted scores on neuropsychological tests administered at the time of imaging.
Results: There was an inverse association between {FSRP} scores and {TCBVr.} The {TCBVr} also showed a significant positive association with performance on tests of attention (Trails A), executive function (Trails B), and visuospatial function (visual reproduction, Hooper visual organization), but not with performance on tests of verbal memory or naming.
Conclusions: The Framingham Stroke Risk Profile may identify subjects with smaller brains and poorer cognitive function among stroke- and dementia-free subjects, reinforcing the importance of managing stroke risk factors.},

However, full intracranial volume measurement requires prolonged scanning and analysis, and simple, validated methods for intracranial volume estimation are lacking. The authors developed and evaluated a method of estimating intracranial volume using a single mid-sagittal slice, the intracranial cross-sectional area. Methods. Forty men aged 65–70 had whole skull magnetic resonance scans at 1.9 T, with slice thickness of 1.5 mm (no interslice gap). Intracranial cross-sectional area was traced in the midline sagittal slice of the 3-view localizer. Intracranial volume was measured using every slice. Ten intracranial cross-sectional area measurements were tested for interrater reliability. Results. Intracranial cross-sectional area and intracranial volume correlated highly (r= .88, P {\textless} .0001). A modified Bland-Altman plot showed good agreement between intracranial cross-sectional area and intracranial volume. The intraclass correlation (an indicator of reliability) for intracranial cross-sectional area was r= .976 (P {\textless} .005). Conclusions. The rapid and simple technique of intracranial cross-sectional area measurement provides a valid and reliable estimate of intracranial volume.},

The most popular standard templates are derived from {MRI} scans of young adults. We introduce specialized templates that allow normalization algorithms to be applied to stroke-aged populations. First, we developed a {CT} template: while this is the dominant modality for many clinical situations, there are no modern {CT} templates and popular algorithms fail to successfully normalize {CT} scans. Importantly, our template was based on healthy individuals with ages similar to what is commonly seen in stroke (mean 65 years old). This template allows studies where only {CT} scans are available. Second, we derived a {MRI} template that approximately matches the shape of our {CT} template as well as processing steps that aid the normalization of scans from older individuals (including lesion masking and the ability to generate high quality cortical renderings despite brain injury). The benefit of this strategy is that the resulting templates can be used in studies where mixed modalities are present. We have integrated these templates and processing algorithms into a simple {SPM} toolbox (http://www.mricro.com/clinical-toolbox/spm8-scripts).},

	abstract = {Background: Mid-life stroke risk factors have been related to late-life cognitive impairment. This association may result not only from clinical strokes but also from subclinical brain injury, such as a global atrophy demonstrable on quantitative brain {MRI.}
Methods: The authors evaluated the community-based cohort of Framingham Offspring Study participants. A total of 1,841 subjects (mean age, 62 years; 857 men, 984 women) who underwent quantitative {MRI} and cognitive testing between 1999 and 2001 and were free of clinical stroke and dementia constituted our study sample. The authors used age- and sex-adjusted linear regression models to relate previous (1991 to 1995) and recent (1998 to 2001) Framingham Stroke Risk Profile ({FSRP)} scores to the total cerebral brain volume ratio ({TCBVr)} on follow-up {MRI}, and further to relate the {TCBVr} with education-adjusted scores on neuropsychological tests administered at the time of imaging.
Results: There was an inverse association between {FSRP} scores and {TCBVr.} The {TCBVr} also showed a significant positive association with performance on tests of attention (Trails A), executive function (Trails B), and visuospatial function (visual reproduction, Hooper visual organization), but not with performance on tests of verbal memory or naming.
Conclusions: The Framingham Stroke Risk Profile may identify subjects with smaller brains and poorer cognitive function among stroke- and dementia-free subjects, reinforcing the importance of managing stroke risk factors.},

Several recent magnetic resonance imaging studies have examined the developmental changes in brain structure and function that underlie improvements in working memory and cognitive control. Increased recruitment of task-relevant regions in the prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex and striatum over the course of development is associated with better performance in a range of cognitive tasks. Further work is needed to assess the role of experience in shaping the neural circuitry that underlies cognitive control.},

It can be used to measure the effect of covariates not only in the center of a population, but also in the upper and lower tails. Moreover, it provides prediction intervals that do not rely on normality or other distributional assumptions. In a nonparametric setting, we explore a class of quantile regression spline estimators of the quantile regression function. We consider an automatic knot selection procedure involving a linear programming method, stepwise knot addition using a modified {AIC}, and stepwise knot deletion using a modified {BIC.} Because the methods estimate quantile regression functions, they possess an inherent robustness to extreme observations in the response values. We investigate the performance of prediction intervals based on automatic quantile regression splines and find that the loss of efficiency of this procedure is minimal in the normal linear homoscedastic model. In heteroscedastic linear models, it outperforms the classical normal theory prediction interval. A data example is provided to illustrate the use of the proposed methods.},

	abstract = {{—After} performing the miracles that take us from conception to birth, and then to sexual maturation and adulthood, natural selection was unable to favor the development of a more elementary mechanism that would simply maintain those earlier miracles forever. The manifestations of this failure are called aging. Because few feral animals age, evolution could not have favored a genetic program for age changes. Natural selection favors animals that are most likely to become reproductively successful by developing better survival strategies and greater reserve capacity in vital systems to better escape predation, disease, accidents, and environmental extremes. Natural selection diminishes after reproductive success because the species will not benefit from members favored for greater longevity. The level of physiological reserve remaining after reproductive maturity determines longevity and evolves incidental to the selection process that acts on earlier developmental events. Physiological reserve does not renew at the same rate that it incurs losses because molecular disorder increases at a rate greater than the capacity for repair. These are age changes, and they increase vulnerability to predation, accidents, or disease. Failure to distinguish aging from disease has not only blurred our efforts to understand the fundamental biology of aging, but it has profound political and economic consequences that compromise the field of biogerontology. Changes attributable to disease, or pathological change, can be distinguished from age changes for at least four important reasons. Unlike any known disease, (1) age changes occur in every human given sufficient time, (2) age changes cross virtually all species barriers, (3) no disease afflicts all members of a species only after the age of reproductive success, and (4) aging occurs in all feral animals subsequently protected by humans, even when that species probably has not experienced aging for thousands or millions of years. The resolution of age-associated diseases will not advance our knowledge of aging, just as the resolution of the diseases of childhood did not advance our knowledge of childhood development. We have failed to convey that greater support must be given to a question that is rarely posed. It is a question that is applicable to all age-associated diseases, and its resolution will also advance our fundamental knowledge of aging: {“Why} are old cells more vulnerable to pathology and disease than are young cells?” During the first half of this century it was believed that because cultured normal cells were immortal, aging must be caused by extracellular events. Thirty-five years ago we overthrough this dogma when we found that normal cells do have a limited capacity to divide, and that age changes can occur intracellularly. We also observed that only abnormal or cancer cells are immortal. Normal cells are mortal because telomeres shorten at each division. Immortal cancer cells express the enzyme telomerase that prevents shortening. Recently, it was discovered that when the catalytic subunit of the telomerase gene is inserted into normal cells they become immortal.},

	abstract = {Background Intracranial hemorrhage is the most feared and lethal complication of oral anticoagulation. We review the frequency, predictors, and prognosis of this most common neurological complication of oral anticoagulation.
Summary of Review Anticoagulation to conventional intensities increases the risk of intracranial hemorrhage 7- to 10-fold, to an absolute rate of nearly 1\%/y for many stroke-prone patients. Most (70\%) anticoagulant-related intracranial hemorrhages are intracerebral hematomas (approximately 60\% are fatal); the bulk of the remainder are subdural hematomas. Predictors of anticoagulant-related intracerebral hematoma are advanced patient age, prior ischemic stroke, hypertension, and intensity of anticoagulation. In approximately half of anticoagulated patients with intracerebral hematoma the bleeding evolves slowly over 12 to 24 hours, and emergency reversal of anticoagulation is crucial.
Conclusions Both patient factors and anticoagulation intensity importantly influence the rate of anticoagulation-related intracranial hemorrhage. Patient-related risk factors for this complication overlap with those for ischemic stroke. The risk/benefit equation of anticoagulation for elderly, stroke-prone patients is complex and differs from that for younger patients. The absolute rate reduction (not the relative risk reduction) of ischemic stroke by anticoagulation is the critical issue and must offset accentuation of often lethal brain hemorrhage.},

It is very robust and accurate and has been tested on thousands of data sets from a wide variety of scanners and taken with a wide variety of {MR} sequences. The method, Brain Extraction Tool ({BET)}, uses a deformable model that evolves to fit the brain's surface by the application of a set of locally adaptive model forces. The method is very fast and requires no preregistration or other pre-processing before being applied. We describe the new method and give examples of results and the results of extensive quantitative testing against “gold-standard” hand segmentations, and two other popular automated methods. Hum.

During 1988, 66 primary lobar hemorrhages occurred, constituting 46\% of all intracerebral hemorrhages in those under 75 years of age and 34\% in those age 75 and older. A history of hypertension was present in 67\% of patients with lobar, 73\% of those with deep, 73\% of those with cerebellar, and 78\% of those with pontine hemorrhages. Left ventricular hypertrophy was present in 21\% of patients with lobar, 27\% of those with deep, and 47\% of those with pontine/cerebellar hemorrhages. The frequency of hypertension in patients with lobar hemorrhage did not decrease with advancing age.
The proportion of all intracerebral hemorrhages that are lobar does not increase with advancing age. Hypertension is nearly as common in primary lobar hemorrhage as in deep, cerebellar, and pontine hemorrhages, and its importance as an associated condition for lobar hemorrhage does not diminish with advancing age.},

	abstract = {Spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage accounts for 20\% of all stroke-related sudden neurological deficits, has the highest morbidity and mortality of all stroke, and the role of surgery remains controversial. We undertook a prospective randomised trial to compare early surgery with initial conservative treatment for patients with intracerebral haemorrhage.
A parallel-group trial design was used. Early surgery combined haematoma evacuation (within 24 h of randomisation) with medical treatment. Initial conservative treatment used medical treatment, although later evacuation was allowed if necessary. We used the eight-point Glasgow outcome scale obtained by postal questionnaires sent directly to patients at 6 months follow-up as the primary outcome measure. We divided the patients into good and poor prognosis groups on the basis of their clinical status at randomisation. For the good prognosis group, a favourable outcome was defined as good recovery or moderate disability on the Glasgow outcome scale. For the poor prognosis group, a favourable outcome also included the upper level of severe disability. Analysis was by intention to treat.
1033 patients from 83 centres in 27 countries were randomised to early surgery (503) or initial conservative treatment (530). At 6 months, 51 patients were lost to follow-up, and 17 were alive with unknown status. Of 468 patients randomised to early surgery, 122 (26\%) had a favourable outcome compared with 118 (24\%) of 496 randomised to initial conservative treatment (odds ratio 0·89 [95\% {CI} 0·66–1·19], p=0·414); absolute benefit 2·3\% (–3·2 to 7·7), relative benefit 10\% (–13 to 33).
Patients with spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage in neurosurgical units show no overall benefit from early surgery when compared with initial conservative treatment.},

Conversely, individuals with {ASD} showed increased short-range connections in lateral–frontal electrodes. This effect between categories showed a consistent parametric dependency: as {ASD} severity increased, short-range coherence was more pronounced and long-range coherence decreased. Theoretical arguments have been proposed arguing that distinct patterns of connectivity may result in networks with different efficiency in transmission of information. We show that the networks in {ASD} subjects have less Clustering coefficient, greater Characteristic Path Length than controls – indicating that the topology of the network departs from small-world behaviour – and greater modularity. Together these results show that delta-band coherence reveal qualitative and quantitative aspects associated with {ASD} pathology.},

	abstract = {Background: Mid-life stroke risk factors have been related to late-life cognitive impairment. This association may result not only from clinical strokes but also from subclinical brain injury, such as a global atrophy demonstrable on quantitative brain {MRI.}
Methods: The authors evaluated the community-based cohort of Framingham Offspring Study participants. A total of 1,841 subjects (mean age, 62 years; 857 men, 984 women) who underwent quantitative {MRI} and cognitive testing between 1999 and 2001 and were free of clinical stroke and dementia constituted our study sample. The authors used age- and sex-adjusted linear regression models to relate previous (1991 to 1995) and recent (1998 to 2001) Framingham Stroke Risk Profile ({FSRP)} scores to the total cerebral brain volume ratio ({TCBVr)} on follow-up {MRI}, and further to relate the {TCBVr} with education-adjusted scores on neuropsychological tests administered at the time of imaging.
Results: There was an inverse association between {FSRP} scores and {TCBVr.} The {TCBVr} also showed a significant positive association with performance on tests of attention (Trails A), executive function (Trails B), and visuospatial function (visual reproduction, Hooper visual organization), but not with performance on tests of verbal memory or naming.
Conclusions: The Framingham Stroke Risk Profile may identify subjects with smaller brains and poorer cognitive function among stroke- and dementia-free subjects, reinforcing the importance of managing stroke risk factors.},

This effect between categories showed a consistent parametric dependency: as {ASD} severity increased, short-range coherence was more pronounced and long-range coherence decreased. Theoretical arguments have been proposed arguing that distinct patterns of connectivity may result in networks with different efficiency in transmission of information. We show that the networks in {ASD} subjects have less Clustering coefficient, greater Characteristic Path Length than controls – indicating that the topology of the network departs from small-world behaviour – and greater modularity. Together these results show that delta-band coherence reveal qualitative and quantitative aspects associated with {ASD} pathology.},

It is shown that properties of solutions to such problems may be quite unexpected. For example, the bootstrap and the jackknife perform very poorly when used to calibrate coverage, although the jackknife estimator of the true coverage is virtually unbiased. A version of the smoothed bootstrap can be employed for successful calibration, however. Interpolation among adjacent order statistics can also be an effective way of calibrating, although even there the results are unexpected. In particular, whereas the coverage error can be reduced from O(n-1) to orders O(n-2) and O(n-3) (where n denotes the sample size) by interpolating among two and three order statistics respectively, the next two orders of reduction require interpolation among five and eight order statistics respectively.},

	abstract = {Higher criticism, or second-level significance testing, is a multiple-comparisons concept mentioned in passing by Tukey. It concerns a situation where there are many independent tests of significance and one is interested in rejecting the joint null hypothesis. Tukey suggested comparing the fraction of observed significances at a given α-level to the expected fraction under the joint null. In fact, he suggested standardizing the difference of the two quantities and forming a z-score; the resulting z-score tests the significance of the body of significance tests. We consider a generalization, where we maximize this z-score over a range of significance levels \$0 {\textless} {\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}leq {\textbackslash}alpha\_0\$ . We are able to show that the resulting higher criticism statistic is effective at resolving a very subtle testing problem: testing whether n normal means are all zero versus the alternative that a small fraction is nonzero. The subtlety of this "sparse normal means" testing problem can be seen from work of Ingster and Jin, who studied such problems in great detail. In their studies, they identified an interesting range of cases where the small fraction of nonzero means is so small that the alternative hypothesis exhibits little noticeable effect on the distribution of the p-values either for the bulk of the tests or for the few most highly significant tests. In this range, when the amplitude of nonzero means is calibrated with the fraction of nonzero means, the likelihood ratio test for a precisely specified alternative would still succeed in separating the two hypotheses. We show that the higher criticism is successful throughout the same region of amplitude sparsity where the likelihood ratio test would succeed. Since it does not require a specification of the alternative, this shows that higher criticism is in a sense optimally adaptive to unknown sparsity and size of the nonnull effects. While our theoretical work is largely asymptotic, we provide simulations in finite samples and suggest some possible applications. We also show that higher critcism works well over a range of non-Gaussian cases.},

We focus on cases where the investigator would like to avoid strong parametric assumptions but the set of covariates is large enough, relative to the available data, to make it problematic to apply standard nonparametric methods because of the well known “curse of dimensionality” problem. In these cases, estimating the conditional quantile function has become increasingly popular. An alternative is to estimate instead the conditional distribution function. Although the choice between these two equivalent representations depends to a large extent on which is more easily interpretable given the purposes of the analysis, considerations of statistical convenience should also be taken into account. We argue that such considerations tend to favor estimating the conditional distribution function directly.},

	abstract = {Accurate identification of brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid ({CSF)} in a whole-head {MRI} is a critical first step in many neuroimaging studies. Automating this procedure can eliminate intra- and interrater variance and greatly increase throughput for a labor-intensive step. Many available procedures perform differently across anatomy and under different acquisition protocols. We developed the Brain Extraction Meta-Algorithm ({BEMA)} to address these concerns. It executes many extraction algorithms and a registration procedure in parallel to combine the results in an intelligent fashion and obtain improved results over any of the individual algorithms. Using an atlas space, {BEMA} performs a voxelwise analysis of training data to determine the optimal Boolean combination of extraction algorithms to produce the most accurate result for a given voxel. This allows the provided extractors to be used differentially across anatomy, increasing both the accuracy and robustness of the procedure. We tested {BEMA} using modified forms of {BrainSuite's} Brain Surface Extractor ({BSE)}, {FSL's} Brain Extraction Tool ({BET)}, {AFNI's} {3dIntracranial}, and {FreeSurfer's} {MRI} Watershed as well as {FSL's} {FLIRT} for the registration procedure. Training was performed on T1-weighted scans of 136 subjects from five separate data sets with different acquisition parameters on separate scanners. Testing was performed on 135 separate subjects from the same data sets. {BEMA} outperformed the individual algorithms, as well as interrater results from a subset of the scans, when compared for the mean Dice coefficient, a rating of the similarity of output masks to the manually defined gold standards.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose— Our purpose was to determine (1) the correlation between quantitative {CT} and {MR} measurements of infarct core, penumbra, and mismatch; and (2) whether the difference between these measurements would alter patient selection for stroke clinical trials.
Methods— We studied 45 patients with acute middle cerebral artery stroke imaged a mean of 3.8 hours after onset (range, 0.48 to 8.35 hours) who underwent {CT} perfusion and {MR} diffusion ({DWI)/perfusion} imaging within 3 hours of each other. The {DWI} and {MR-mean} transit time ({MTT)} abnormalities were visually segmented using a semiautomated commercial analysis program. The {CT-cerebral} blood volume) and {CT-MTT} lesions were automatically segmented using a relative cerebral blood volume threshold of 0.56 and a relative {MTT} threshold of 1.50 on commercially available software. Percent mismatch was defined as [({MTT−DWI)/DWI} volume]×100. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated.
Results— There were significant correlations for {DWI} versus {CT-cerebral} blood volume lesion volumes (r2=0.88, P{\textless}0.001), for {MR-MTT} versus {CT-MTT} lesion volumes(r2=0.86, P{\textless}0.001), and for {MR-MTT/DWI} versus {CT-MTT/CT-cerebral} blood volume mismatch lesion volumes(r2=0.81, P{\textless}0.001). {MR} perfusion and {CT} perfusion agreed for determining: (1) infarct core {\textless} versus ≥100 {mL} in 41 of 45 (91.1\%); (2) {MTT} lesion size {\textless} versus {\textgreater}2 cm diameter in 42 of 45 (93.3\%); (3) mismatch {\textless} versus {\textgreater}20\% in 41 of 45 (91.1\%); and (4) inclusion versus exclusion from trial enrollment in 38 of 45 (84.4\%) patients. Six of 7 disagreements were due to inadequate {CT} coverage.
Conclusion— Advanced {MR} and {CT} perfusion imaging measurements of core/penumbra mismatch for patient selection in stroke trials are highly correlated when {CT} perfusion coverage is sufficient to include most of the ischemic region. Although {MR} is currently the preferred imaging method for determining core and penumbra, {CT} perfusion is comparable and potentially more available.},

Methods: Spontaneous eyes-closed and eyes-open {EEG} were recorded at 128 electrodes in 20 children aged 6–11 years and 23 adults aged 18–23 years. The surface Laplacian algorithm was applied to improve the spatial resolution of each electrode. Power and coherence were used to characterize the spatial structure of the alpha rhythm. A stochastic field model was used to eliminate coherences that are inflated due to volume conduction. Results: In adults, the alpha rhythm is characterized by very high coherence between distant electrodes. The children demonstrated reduced anterior power and coherence between anterior and posterior electrodes at the peak alpha frequency in comparison to the adults. The Laplacian alpha rhythm demonstrated much higher power in the children at both anterior and posterior electrodes, but was weakly correlated between electrodes. Conclusions: The maturation of neocortex in late childhood involves increased global correlation by long-range corticocortical connections. The local correlation that contributes power to each electrode, independent of other electrodes, is reduced as the global correlation increases.},

	abstract = {While neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by steady degeneration over relatively long timelines, it is widely believed that the early stages are the most promising for therapeutic intervention, before irreversible neuronal loss occurs. Developing a therapeutic response requires a precise measure of disease progression. However, since the early stages are for the most part asymptomatic, obtaining accurate measures of disease progression is difficult. Longitudinal databases of hundreds of subjects observed during several years with tens of validated biomarkers are becoming available, allowing the use of computational methods. We propose a widely applicable statistical methodology for creating a disease progression score ({DPS)}, using multiple biomarkers, for subjects with a neurodegenerative disease. The proposed methodology was evaluated for Alzheimer's disease ({AD)} using the publicly available {AD} Neuroimaging Initiative ({ADNI)} database, yielding an Alzheimer's {DPS} or {ADPS} score for each subject and each time-point in the database. In addition, a common description of biomarker changes was produced allowing for an ordering of the biomarkers. The Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test delayed recall was found to be the earliest biomarker to become abnormal. The group of biomarkers comprising the volume of the hippocampus and the protein concentration amyloid beta and Tau were next in the timeline, and these were followed by three cognitive biomarkers. The proposed methodology thus has potential to stage individuals according to their state of disease progression relative to a population and to deduce common behaviors of biomarkers in the disease itself.},

The first step is automatic determination of head symmetry axis, with the possibility of manual improvement of the result if necessary. Symmetry axis calculation is based on moments. In the second step, the seeded region-growing ({SRG)} algorithm is used to segment the input image into a number of regions having uniform brightness. Features of these regions, such as brightness, area, neighborhood and relative position to the symmetry axis are used to create facts for a rule-based expert system. Based on created facts and pre-defined rules as input, the rule-based expert system is used in the third step to label regions as background, skull, gray/white matter, {CSF} and stroke.
